Young played acoustic guitar and harmonica, and sang two songs: Comes A Time,\u00a0which has a chorus about tall trees, and his hit Heart of Gold. Young, billed as a \"special guest,\" was not listed as appearing at the event, where astonished protesters, many dressed as trees and wild animals, cheered wildly and sang along to Heart of Gold. \"Thank you Canada,\" said Young. \"You know I'm only here for those trees up there and it's a beautiful, and it's a precious, sacred thing, these old trees because they show us the power of nature when we are being threatened. They show us the past and they show us our future.\" \"That's something I hope our Canadian government and business section will recognize that this has to do with Canada,\" he said. \"It has to do with the ages, if we are lucky enough to have ages. These trees have lasted so long they deserve Canada's respect.\" Earlier this month, the B.C. government introduced new approaches to managing\u00a0timber resources to protect more old-growth trees from logging. Premier David Eby said more areas are now being deferred from logging than ever on record. The old-growth deferral is a government program in B.C. where old-growth areas slated for logging are now deferred until a later date or not logged at all.

Young was introduced by his wife, actress Daryl Hannah, who said the cold weather was giving her a bit of brain freeze. \"Despite the complexities, the necessary and simple answer is do no harm,'' she said. \"No further destruction.

From Kostan Nechyporenko in Kyiv Ukraine\u2019s commander of joint forces operation has been dismissed from his post, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced in a decree Sunday. Major Gen. Eduard Mykhailovich Moskalov\u00a0had been appointed to the position last March when Lt. Gen. Oleksandr Pavliuk was appointed head of the Kyiv region military administration. Zelensky did not provide an explanation for Moskalov's dismissal, but it's the latest in a long line of recent leadership changes made by his administration. Ukrainian authorities have conducted a series of anti-corruption searches and crackdowns across the country, and a variety of high-profile firings have followed. It is not yet clear if Moskalov's firing was connected to the recent corruption purge. From CNN's Em Steck,\u00a0Andrew Kaczynski\u00a0and\u00a0Olivia Alafriz   Florida Gov.\u00a0Ron DeSantis\u00a0once strongly supported arming Ukraine to fight Russia, urging then-President Barack Obama to do so as a deterrent to Russian aggression in eastern Europe \u2013 a position at odds with his statements this week questioning the United States\u2019 involvement in the conflict. As a conservative congressman, DeSantis, now a likely presidential hopeful, urged sending \u201cdefensive and offensive\u201d weapons to Ukraine in 2014 and 2015, according to a review of his past comments by CNN\u2019s KFile. He also voted to refuse to fund a new missile defense treaty with Russia until they withdrew from Ukraine. Once an advocate of a hardline, hawkish approach to Russia by supporting Ukraine, the Florida governor shifted course this week in anticipation of a potential presidential run, where he will vie for the nomination of a changed, more isolationist Republican party. In new comments, the Florida governor criticized what he called a \"blank check\" approach to aid for Ukraine, and questioned whether\u00a0it was in the United States\u2019 interest to remain involved if the conflict came down to \u201cthings like the borderlands or over Crimea.\u201d In comparison to China, DeSantis said Russia was not \u201cthe same threat to our country, even though they\u2019re hostile\u201d and downplayed the threats that Russia could invade NATO countries. DeSantis\u2019 foreign policy pivot from being a self-described follower of the \u201cReagan school\u201d of foreign policy to a more Trumpian worldview comes as the Republican Party\u2019s voting base has grown increasingly isolationist.\u00a0 A recent poll from Pew Research Center\u00a0shows 40% of Republican and Republican-leaning independent voters now believe the US is providing too much support for Ukraine, up from 9% last year. A CNN KFile review of DeSantis\u2019 past comments and actions found that DeSantis consistently supported sending aid to Ukraine and condemned the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and 2015 and as late as 2017. Read the full review here. Analysis by CNN's Rob Picheta Tensions are mounting in Moldova, a small country on Ukraine\u2019s southwestern border, where Russia has been accused of laying the groundwork for a coup that could drag the nation into\u00a0the Kremlin\u2019s war. Moldovan President Maia Sandu has accused Russia of using \u201csaboteurs\u201d disguised as civilians to stoke unrest amid a period of political instability, echoing similar warnings from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Russian President Vladimir Putin has meanwhile baselessly accused Kyiv of planning its own assault on\u00a0a pro-Russian territory in Moldova,\u00a0where Moscow has a military foothold. What is Russia planning? Despite Moscow\u2019s pleas of innocence, its actions regarding Moldova bear a striking resemblance to moves it made ahead of its annexation of Crimea in 2014, and its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year. On Tuesday, Putin revoked a 2012 foreign policy decree that in part recognized Moldova\u2019s independence, according to\u00a0Reuters. Then on Thursday, Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defence accused Ukraine of \u201cpreparing an armed provocation\u201d against Moldova\u2019s pro-Russian separatist region of Transnistria \u201cin the near future,\u201d state media TASS reported. No evidence or further details were offered to support the ministry\u2019s accusation, and it has been rubbished by Moldova. But the claim has put Western leaders on alert, coming almost exactly a year after Putin made similar, unsubstantiated claims that Russians were being targeted in the Donbas \u2013 the eastern flank of Ukraine where Moscow had supported militant separatists since 2014 \u2013 allowing him to cast his invasion of the country as an issue of self-defense. Russia's existing foothold in the country: Central to Russia\u2019s interests in Moldova is Transnistria, a breakaway territory on the eastern flank of the country that has housed Russian troops for decades. The territory \u2013 a 1,300 square mile enclave on the Dniester River \u2013 declared itself a Soviet republic in 1990, opposing any attempt by Moldova to become an independent state or to merge with Romania after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. When Moldova became independent the following year, Russia quickly inserted itself as a so-called \u201cpeacekeeping force\u201d in Transnistria, sending troops in to back pro-Moscow separatists there. War with Moldovan forces ensued, and the conflict ended in a deadlock in 1992. Transnistria was not recognized internationally, even by Russia, but Moldovan forces left it a de facto breakaway state. That deadlock has left the territory and its estimated 500,000 inhabitants trapped in limbo, with the government in Chi\u0219in\u0103u holding virtually no control over it to this day.  From Kostan Nechyporenko in Kyiv   For the first time since the two countries established diplomatic relations 30 years ago, a Saudi foreign minister has visited Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky's office released a video of him meeting Saudi Arabia's\u00a0Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud on Sunday.  Zelensky said he expected the meeting would \"provide a new impetus to further intensification of our mutually beneficial dialogue.\" \"Thank you for supporting peace in Ukraine, our sovereignty, and territorial integrity,\" he continued. \"This is very important for us and our society.\" Saudi Arabia has steered a neutral course in the conflict. The Kingdom mediated a prisoner exchange last year, in which two American and five British citizens were released from Russian detention.\u00a0 Andriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian presidential office, called the meeting successful in a message on Telegram. \"Ukraine and Saudi Arabia have common challenges and experiences in dealing with them. We are talking about Iranian UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones) that were supplied to certain 'rebels' and attacked Saudi oil facilities,\" Yermak said, in a reference to the use of Iranian drones by Houthi forces in Yemen. \"Since last year, the same Iranian UAVs have been in possession of Russian terrorists and have been attacking Ukraine's energy infrastructure.\"   From CNN\u2019s Sam Fossum   Director of the US CIA William Burns said in an interview Sunday that the alliance between Russia and Iran is developing rapidly, an emerging narrative that he called \"disturbing.\"  Burns said the CIA is also seeing signs that Russia is proposing to help the Iranians on their missile program, and at least considering the possibility of providing fighter aircraft to Iran, in exchange for military aid in their ongoing invasion. Meeting with Russia's spy chief: Burns also described his conversation with the director of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, and said Russian President Vladimir Putin is \"too confident\" in his ability to grind down Ukraine. He called the discussion with Naryshkin \"pretty dispiriting,\" but said he got some key points across. Asked why the conversation was dispiriting, Burns added: \"There was a very defiant attitude on the part of Mr. Naryshkin as well, a sense of cockiness and hubris, reflecting Putin's own view \u2014 his own belief today that he can make time work for him, that he believes he can grind down the Ukrainians, that he can wear down our European allies, that political fatigue will eventually set in.\"\u00a0 From CNN\u2019s Sam Fossum In an interview Sunday, US House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul urged President Joe Biden's administration to provide more advanced weapons systems to Ukraine, and said Congress would take steps to move the process along. McCaul warned critics of US support for Ukraine that \"we can't put our head in the sand.\" \"We can certainly write into our appropriations bills, prioritizing weapons systems. We intend to do that,\" McCaul said on \"ABC This Week,\" when asked what Congress can do to push the Biden administration on providing longer-range missile systems or fighter jets. McCaul said he believed the US could have already been doing more to speed up a conclusion to the conflict. Biden and senior administration officials have said \"for now\" Ukraine doesn't require advanced fighter jets, and the US has rebuffed Ukrainian entreaties for long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems over concerns they could be used by Ukraine to hit targets deep inside Russia. McCaul said he recently spoke with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, and that nothing is off the table right now.\u00a0 \"I think with enough pressure from Congress on both sides of the aisle, we can get into Ukraine what they really need to win this fight,\" the lawmaker said. As far-right Republican criticism grows over the US' continued support of Ukraine, and some saying the White House should be spending more energy on domestic crises like the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, McCaul said the US can walk and chew gum at the same time.\u00a0 \"I think that's a false choice. I think the president should have gone to (East) Palestine where we have this major chemical spill, but it doesn't mean we disregard what's happening \u2014 this struggle for the global balance of power that we're facing right now,\" McCaul said.  From CNN's Tim Lister    There is one thing that Russian and Ukrainian accounts agree upon: The fighting around the eastern city of Bakhmut is relentless, and the casualties \u2014 on both sides \u2014 are high.\u00a0 A fierce fight in the streets: Until a few weeks ago, the battle was waged largely with tanks, artillery and mortars. But Bakhmut has increasingly become a field of urban combat, with every street and building in the suburbs and surrounding villages contested. Russian forces \u2014 including fighters from the Wagner private military company \u2014 have edged toward the center of the city from the east, south and north.  Ukrainian units have launched frequent counter-attacks to try to reclaim some territory and preserve their precarious access to Bakhmut from the west. That access has become gradually more complicated as routes into the city have come under control of Russian forces. Ukrainian soldiers on unofficial social media accounts have said they are increasingly reliant on dirt roads to reach \u2014 and leave \u2014 Bakhmut, tracks that may become impassable as the frost turns to mud. Russia aims to encircle Ukraine's troops: Rather than drive directly toward the city center, Wagner groups have sought to surround the city in a wide arc from the north. In January, the groups claimed the nearby town of Soledar, and have since taken a string of villages and hamlets north of Bakhmut. That process appears to have gone a step further in recent days, with Wagner apparently reaching the village of Yahidne immediately to the northwest of Bakhmut. The village sits on a route that, until recently, was used by Ukrainians to get in and out of the city. The next\u00a0target\u00a0for the Russians could be the town of Chasiv Yar, a straggling collection of Soviet-era apartment blocks, sitting on high ground which has already been extensively damaged. Ukrainian officials said it came under artillery fire again Sunday. How long will Ukraine defend the city? The conundrum for the Ukrainian military is whether it remains feasible to continue defending Bakhmut. At the beginning of February, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said,\u00a0\"No one will surrender Bakhmut. We will fight as long as we can. We consider Bakhmut our fortress.\" More recently, in an interview with Italian media, Zelensky's tone was slightly different.\u00a0\u201cIt is important for us to defend (Bakhmut), but not at any price and not for everyone to die,\u201d he was quoted as saying. If Bakhmut can no longer be held, it will be important to note where Ukrainians choose to draw their next defensive lines. The cities of Kostiantynivka and Kramatorsk are not far to the west of Bakhmut and have already registered an uptick in Russian missile attacks.\u00a0\u00a0 For now, there's no sign of a withdrawal of Ukrainian units from the Bakhmut area, and the brutal fighting wears on. From CNN\u2019s Jasmine Wright US national security adviser Jake Sullivan would not say whether the Biden administration would support Ukraine if it decides victory against Russia requires retaking Crimea. Sunday marks the ninth anniversary of Russia\u2019s annexation of the peninsula.\u00a0 Asked directly if the US would help Ukraine take back Crimea, Sullivan punted again on NBC\u2019s \"Meet the Press,\" repeating that the most critical thing right now is supplying Ukraine with the tools to take back territory in the south and east. Asked by Bash on CNN to level with the American people on how long the war will last, Sullivan said: \u201cWar is unpredictable.\u201d He reiterated US President Joe Biden\u2019s Friday statement that the administration was ruling out providing F-16 fighter jets \u201cfor now.\u201d Sullivan would not say whether the US would provide jets down the line. On China, Sullivan told Bash that the US has still not seen Beijing make a final decision on whether to provide Russia lethal aid for the war. He also declined to detail what consequences China would face if they made such a move.\u00a0 \u201cPresident Biden has said previously, we're not just making direct threats. We're just laying out both the stakes and the consequences, how things would unfold and we are doing that clearly \u2014 and specifically behind closed doors,\u201d he said.

French President Emmanuel Macron has said he will visit China in April to seek the Chinese government\u2019s help with ending Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The announcement on Saturday came after China published a 12-point position paper that called for a ceasefire and a \u201cpolitical settlement\u201d to end the year-long conflict. Macron, speaking on the sidelines of an agricultural show in Paris, said he would visit China in \u201cearly April\u201d. \u201cThe fact that China is engaging in peace efforts is a good thing,\u201d the French leader said, stressing that peace was only possible if \u201cRussian aggression was halted, troops withdrawn, and the territorial sovereignty of Ukraine and its people was respected\u201d. \u201cChina must help us put pressure on Russia so that it never uses chemical or nuclear weapons \u2026 and that it stops its aggression as a precondition for talks,\u201d he added. Beijing has sought to position itself as a neutral party on the conflict, even as it has maintained close ties with Russia and helped scuttle a joint statement condemning the war at a G20 gathering in India. The Chinese position paper, published on the anniversary of the conflict, said war benefits no one and\u00a0urged all parties to \u201csupport Russia and Ukraine in working in the same direction and resuming direct dialogue as quickly as possible\u201d. Released by the foreign ministry, the plan urges an end to Western sanctions against Russia, the establishment of humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of civilians and steps to ensure the export of grain after disruptions caused global food prices to spike last year. It also made clear its opposition to the use and threat of deploying nuclear weapons after Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to use Moscow\u2019s atomic arsenal in the conflict. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed China\u2019s efforts on Friday, saying Kyiv needed to cooperate with Beijing to put an end to the war. \u201cChina started talking about Ukraine, and that\u2019s not bad,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cIt seems to me that there is respect for our territorial integrity, security issues.\u201d \u201cWe need to work with China on this point. \u2026 Our task is to unite everyone in order to isolate one,\u201d he added. The Ukrainian leader also expressed hopes to meet Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, calling it \u201cimportant for world security\u201d. But some of Ukraine\u2019s allies have expressed scepticism at China\u2019s commitment to brokering peace, nodding to Beijing\u2019s close ties to Moscow. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said China was not well placed to negotiate an end to the war. \u201cChina doesn\u2019t have much credibility because they have not been able to condemn the illegal invasion of Ukraine,\u201d he told reporters, adding that Beijing had signed an agreement with Putin days before the invasion, pledging a \u201cno limits\u201d partnership. The United States has also said China was \u201cconsidering providing lethal support\u201d to Russia, a claim that Beijing has denied. Analysts in China meanwhile say Beijing\u2019s refusal to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine makes it \u201cthe only honest broker who can help resolve the conflict\u201d. \u201cChina as one of the largest economies in the world certainly benefits from an end to hostilities,\u201d said Andy Mok, senior research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization think tank. \u201cFrom a reputation prestige perspective, playing a role in bringing this conflict to a close when no other major power has been able to do so would burnish China\u2019s reputation,\u201d he told Al Jazeera. \u201cBut we have to recognise that there\u2019s only so much that an honest broker can do and sometimes, both sides have to fight to a certain amount of exhaustion before there can be a negotiated settlement and whether we are at this point or not, remains to be seen.\u201d Macron\u2019s announcement of his Beijing visit came shortly after the Chinese foreign ministry said Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko would pay a state visit from February 28 to March 2 at Xi\u2019s invitation. A longtime ally of Putin, Lukashenko is beholden to the Russian president for shoring him up in 2020 after mass protests broke out against a presidential election that the Belarus opposition and Western governments said had been rigged. Lukashenko has denied the claims and accused the West of funding protesters. He has supported Putin in his year-long war with Ukraine, including by letting him invade from Belarusian territory and by allowing Russia to train newly mobilised troops in Belarus. Ukraine has expressed concerns that Belarus could again support Moscow in its war effort, with the countries announcing the creation of a joint regional force last October. The Chinese government, in a statement, said Foreign Minister Qin Gang told his Belarusian counterpart Sergei Aleinik in a phone call on Friday that Beijing was willing to work with Minsk to deepen mutual political trust. China would also continue to support Belarus in maintaining national stability and oppose attempts by \u201cexternal forces\u201d to interfere in its internal affairs or impose \u201cillegal\u201d unilateral sanctions on Minsk, Qin told Aleinik.
