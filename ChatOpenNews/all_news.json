United States actress Raquel Welch \u2014 whose emergence from the sea in a skimpy, furry bikini for the film One Million Years BC propelled her to international sex symbol status throughout the 1960s and \u201970s \u2014 has died. She was 82. Welch passed away early on Wednesday after a brief illness, according to her agent, Stephen LaManna of the talent agency Innovative Artists. Welch\u2019s breakthrough came in the 1966\u2019s campy prehistoric flick One Million Years BC, despite having a total of three lines. Clad in a brown doeskin bikini, she successfully evaded pterodactyls but not the notice of the public. \u201cI just thought it was a goofy dinosaur epic we\u2019d be able to sweep under the carpet one day,\u201d she told The Associated Press in 1981. \u201cWrong. It turned out that I was the Bo Derek of the season, the lady in the loin cloth about whom everyone said, \u2018My God, what a bod\u2019, and they expected to disappear overnight.\u201d She did not. Instead, the very next year, she played the role of Lust for the comedy team of Peter Cook and Dudley Moore in their film Bedazzled, as well as a secret agent in a sexy spy spoof called Fathom. Her curves and beauty captured pop-culture attention, with Playboy crowning her the \u201cmost desired woman\u201d of the 1970s, though she never appeared completely naked in the magazine. In 2013, she graced the No 2 spot on Men\u2019s Health\u2019s \u201cHottest Women of All Time\u201d list. And in the film The Shawshank Redemption, a poster of Welch covers an escape tunnel \u2014 the last of three images character Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) used, alongside posters of Rita Hayworth and Marilyn Monroe. Admirers took to Twitter to mourn the star, including TV host Rosie O\u2019Donnell and actor Chris Meloni. Writer-director Paul Feig, who worked with Welch on the TV series Sabrina the Teenage Witch, called her \u201ckind, funny and a true superstar whom I was pretty much in love with for most of my childhood\u201d. He added: \u201cWe\u2019ve lost a true icon.\u201d In addition to acting, Welch was a singer and dancer. She surprised many critics and won positive reviews when she starred in the 1981 musical Woman of the Year on Broadway, replacing a vacationing Lauren Bacall. She returned to the Great White Way in 1997 for the musical comedy Victor/Victoria. She knew some people did not take her seriously because of her glamorous image. \u201cI\u2019m not Penny Marshall or Barbra Streisand,\u201d she told the Associated Press in 1993. \u201cThey\u2019ll say, \u2018Raquel Welch wants to direct? Give me a break\u2019.\u201d Welch was born Jo-Raquel Tejada in Chicago, Illinois, and raised in La Jolla, California. (The Jo in her name was from her mother, Josephine.) Welch herself was a divorced mother when she met actor-turned-press agent Patrick Curtis. \u201cThe irony of it all is that, even though people thought of me as a sex symbol, in reality I was a single mother of two small children!\u201d she wrote in her autobiography, Raquel: Beyond the Cleavage. This is so sad. I had the great pleasure of working with Ms. Welch when I was a regular on Sabrina the Teenage Witch and she was awesome. Kind, funny and a true superstar whom I was pretty much in love with for most of my childhood. We\u2019ve lost a true icon. https://t.co/7RWiSn9e4P \u2014 Paul Feig (@paulfeig) February 15, 2023  Curtis became her manager and second husband. He helped shape her into a glamour girl with hundreds of magazine covers and a string of movies, plus exercise videos and books like The Raquel Welch Total Beauty and Fitness Program. Though she would appear in exploitative films, she also surprised many in the industry with fine performances, including in Richard Lester\u2019s period piece The Three Musketeers, which earned her a Golden Globe. She was also acclaimed for her role in the Merchant Ivory comedy-drama The Wild Party, opposite James Coco. Another Globe nomination came in 1988 for the TV movie Right to Die. She later played herself and mocked divas in an episode of the TV sitcom Seinfeld, memorably attacking the character Elaine and rattling her friend Kramer. Married and divorced four times, she is survived by two children, Damon Welch and Tahnee Welch, who also became an actress, including landing a featured role in the 1985 science-fiction film Cocoon.

According to the Government of Canada, this brings the total amount of money given to B.C. through that program to more than $1 billion.\u00a0 On Nov. 13, 2021, heavy rain began to fall across much of the province. Within days, communities were virtually underwater as thousands of people were displaced and farmlands were destroyed. Thousands of livestock perished and five people died in a mudslide as a result of the downpour.\u00a0 The rains swelled numerous rivers, which washed away bridges and stretches of highway, cutting off the Lower Mainland from the rest of the country. \"The area was unrecognizable,\" Abbotsford\u2013Mission MLA and Minister of Agriculture Pam Alexis said on Thursday.\u00a0 \"It was just unimaginable the kind of damage we saw.\" More than a year later, British Columbians are still rebuilding, and some say they've only received disaster relief funding in the last few months.\u00a0 John Jongema, a farmer on the Sumas Prairie, told CBC he's still working to fix the damage to his shed after it was damaged by\u00a0floodwaters.\u00a0 \"I walk around the neighbourhood and there's still three\u00a0or four\u00a0homes just on my street that haven't been rebuilt,\" he said, noting that he's worried the region isn't ready to withstand another major atmospheric river event. In the B.C. Interior, Merritt cattle rancher Rhonda MacDonald said\u00a0the river is running where her land used to be. \"We have huge hayfields that the river ran over,\" she explained, adding that she lost nearly three hectares of land and nearly $1 million\u00a0worth of fencing and other farm implements. The Insurance Bureau of Canada has estimated the cost of insured flood damage was at least $450 million, making it the most expensive disaster in B.C. history. Provinces and territories can apply for DFAA assistance in the event of a large-scale disaster within six months of it happening.\u00a0 Once the event has been designated under the DFAA, provinces and territories have up to five years to submit their final claim, to cover the cost of things like evacuation operations, restoring public works and infrastructure and replacing or repairing basic, essential personal property of individuals, small businesses or farms. Blair said the province will work with First Nations, regional and municipal governments and businesses to determine how the money will be allocated.

Pink Shirt Day, also known as anti-bullying day, falls on the last Wednesday of February and highlights\u00a0anti-bullying initiatives at schools across the country.\u00a0 The day started in 2007 after a Grade 9\u00a0student in Nova Scotia was bullied for wearing a pink shirt to school. The following day, fellow students of his school\u00a0wore\u00a0pink shirts to school in solidarity with the victim. Since then, people have joined Pink Shirt Day every year, donning pink shirts, tops or wristbands to participate in the movement against bullying, harassment and violence.\u00a0 Bonnie Leadbeater, a professor of psychology at the University of Victoria, says bullying underlies many of our\u00a0social problems, including domestic violence, dating violence, gang violence and youth suicides. She says Canada has a \"gruesome\" ranking when it comes to bullying. UNICEF's 2023 report on child well-being in wealthy countries found that Canada's rate of bullying ranked 23rd out of 33 countries. Leadbeater\u00a0says children in the current generation are also more vulnerable to cyberbullying. \"We need proactive, positive approaches to peer conflict and to aggression,\" she told CBC's BC Today host Michelle Eliot. She says parents and teachers should teach the etiquette of cyber communications \u2014 what she calls the netiquette method.\u00a0 Julie, a grandparent, former teacher and resident of Roberts Creek, B.C., says one way to build positive interactions among students is to guide them through their behaviours.\u00a0 \"I would say, 'What is this behaviour like? Is this behaviour respectful? Do you think this behaviour will help people be peaceful?'\" she asked. \"And students, I found, were incredibly honest.\" \"I would try to respond and relate it to people's feelings, which is usually why people are bullies because, in some way, their own needs are not.\" Leadbeater agrees.\u00a0 She says children who bully are often children who are victimized as well. Leadbeater is also the founder of the WITS program, which talks about what children should do if they're being teased or bullied.\u00a0 WITS stands for Walk away, Ignore, Talk about it, Seek help.\u00a0 The program began in Victoria and is focused on the idea of seeking help and encouraging children to open\u00a0up about their experiences.\u00a0 \"Schools now are more open than they used to be to children's concerns and children's complaints, that we understand better that children who are victimized can benefit from help-seeking,\" she said.\u00a0 Kelly, a resident of Kelowna, says bullying is also a result of stereotypical expectations.\u00a0 She says parents should have open conversations with their children about what's happening in the world and emphasize the importance of empathy and kindness and ingrain the idea that \"if I wouldn't like that to happen to me, I wouldn't do it to someone else.\" \"Did the parents wear pink shirts to try to really encourage the conversation? Like, 'Oh, why are you wearing a pink shirt, dad?'\" she asks.\u00a0 While bullying is a genderless problem, Leadbeater says people with different sexual orientations, people with different physical appearances and people from different minority groups experience bullying disproportionately. She says\u00a0it hurts those children the most who are still trying to figure themselves out.\u00a0 Leadbeater's point echoes the province's theme for this year's Pink Shirt Day, \"Be bold.\u00a0Be bright.\u00a0Be you,\" Premier David Eby and Education Minister Rachna Singh said Wednesday\u00a0in a statement\u00a0the well-being and safety of students and staff in the K-12 education system is the province's top priority. \"We are committed to making sure our schools are places where children of all sexual orientations, gender identities (SOGI) and gender expressions feel safe, accepted and respected.\"  Priya Bhat is a journalist at CBC Vancouver.
