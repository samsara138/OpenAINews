    <p style="font-family: ; font-size: medium;color: #183A1D;">On Saturday, Canadian music legend Neil Young made a surprise appearance at an old-growth logging protest rally at the British Columbia legislature. He played acoustic guitar and harmonica and sang two songs, Comes A Time and Heart of Gold. Young spoke about the importance of respecting the old trees and urged the Canadian government and business section to recognize their value. Earlier this month, the B.C. government announced new approaches to managing timber resources to protect more old-growth trees from logging.</p>

    <p style="font-family: ; font-size: medium;color: #183A1D;">Major General Eduard Mykhailovich Moskalov of Ukraine's joint forces operation has been dismissed from his post. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has changed his stance on providing weapons to Ukraine, and Saudi Arabia has sent a foreign minister to Ukraine for the first time in 30 years. Tensions are rising in Moldova due to Russian activity there, and William Burns, Director of the US CIA, has expressed concern over the alliance between Russia and Iran.

        <b style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: large; color: #cc0808;">French President Emmanuel Macron is planning to visit China to seek help from Chinese President Xi Jinping to end the war between Russia and Ukraine.</b>

    <p style="font-family: ; font-size: medium;color: #183A1D;">French President Emmanuel Macron has said he will visit China in April to seek the Chinese government's help with ending Russia's invasion of Ukraine. China has published a 12-point position paper calling for a ceasefire and a political settlement, as well as an end to Western sanctions against Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has welcomed China's efforts, while NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has expressed scepticism. Analysts say that China's refusal to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine makes it an "honest broker" who can help resolve the conflict. China has also invited Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko for a state visit, expressing its support for his country's stability and opposition to external interference.</p>

        <b style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: large; color: #cc0808;">The Canadian federal government is going to invest more than $500 million into the recovery from flooding in British Columbia.</b>

    <p style="font-family: ; font-size: small; color: #183A1D;">Google News</p>
    <p style="font-family: ; font-size: medium;color: #183A1D;">The Federal Government is providing British Columbia with more than $500 million to help cover the costs of the devastating floods in 2021. This money is being provided through the Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements (DFAA) program, bringing the total amount given to British Columbia to over $1 billion. The flooding resulted in five deaths and displaced thousands of people, as well as destroying farmlands, damaging homes, infrastructure, and livestock. The Insurance Bureau of Canada estimates that the cost of insured flood damage is at least $450 million. Provinces and territories have up to five years to submit their final claim for DFAA assistance.</p>

        <b style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: large; color: #cc0808;">On Pink Shirt Day, a University of Victoria professor encourages people to take the opportunity to reflect on the damage bullying can cause to society.</b>
    </a>
    <p style="font-family: ; font-size: small; color: #183A1D;">CBC News</p>
    <p style="font-family: ; font-size: medium;color: #183A1D;">On Pink Shirt Day, Canadian professor Bonnie Leadbeater says that bullying is at the root of many of our social problems, such as domestic violence and youth suicides. Julie, a former teacher from Roberts Creek, suggests guiding students through their behaviours to build positive interactions. Leadbeater agrees that children who bully are often victims themselves and encourages the netiquette method and WITS (walk away, ignore, talk about it, seek help). Kelly, a resident of Kelowna, believes parents should have open conversations with their children about empathy and kindness. The province is committed to ensuring that all students feel safe, accepted, and respected.</p>
